## Live-Project

# Introduction 
Working on C# live project was one of most rewarding challenges I have taken part in. I got to add contribution in building an MVC application. I learned how to expand my thought process and look at the bigger picture. I also got a much better understanding of how to just go in headfirst and start doing what I know how to do, rather than worry about the concepts that I do not. It made me gain confidence working on my own smaller piece of the project and learn on the job the importance of working as a team. During the course of the two weeks, I was able to complete multiple stories, including front end stories, bug fixing, and back-end stories. 
Below are code snippets and description of the stories.

# Debugging Story
The Donation Button when I started the story was not working, my task was to create a new view and from there create a form.

* Create SurveyAnalyst:<br>
My objective for this story was to create a survey analyst class which keeps track of how many times the analyst called the customer back and the amount of time in days that a survey would be offered to the customer

* Seed SurveyAnalyst:<br>
For this story it was my job to create a seeding method that would seed one SurveyAnalyst in the database, the second part of this story was to assign "SurveyAnalyst" as role and have that seeded along with the SurveyAnalyst information.
