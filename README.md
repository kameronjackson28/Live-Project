# Live-Project

# Introduction 
Working on C# live project was one of most rewarding challenges I have taken part in. I got to add contribution in building an MVC application. I learned how to expand my thought process and look at the bigger picture. I also got a much better understanding of how to just go in headfirst and start doing what I know how to do, rather than worry about the concepts that I do not. It made me gain confidence working on my own smaller piece of the project and learn on the job the importance of working as a team. During the course of the two weeks, I was able to complete multiple stories, including front end stories, bug fixing, and back-end stories. 
Below are code snippets and description of the stories.

# Debugging Story
The Donation Button when I started the story was not working, my task was to create a new view and from there create a form.
